# OOP-Parking-Garage 

Mohammed, Dylan, and James all worked on this project at the same time, taking turns sharing our screens and all doing it together. 

Dylan added the credit card requirement later on, and James fixed a few lines of code at the end but other then that everything was done together as a team effort.
